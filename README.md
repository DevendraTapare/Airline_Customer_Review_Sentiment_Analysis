## Project Overview
The goal is to understand customer sentiments from airline reviews to improve customer service. This project involves preprocessing text data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training various models for sentiment classification.

## Features
- Preprocesses text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
- Visualizes sentiment distributions and common terms.
- Implements machine learning models like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning text data.
   - Removing stopwords and punctuation.
   - Vectorizing text using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing word frequencies.
   - Visualizing sentiment trends.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Training models on preprocessed data.
   - Comparing their performance using validation sets.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Calculating metrics like confusion matrix, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `NumPy`, `Pandas`: Data manipulation.
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`: Visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `spaCy`: Machine learning and NLP.
